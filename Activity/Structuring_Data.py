# # Activity: Structure your data 

# ## Introduction
# 
# In this activity, you will practice structuring, an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** step that helps data science projects move forward. During EDA, when working with data that contains aspects of date and time, "datetime" transformations are integral to better understanding the data. As a data professional, you will encounter datetime transformations quite often as you determine how to format your data to suit the problems you want to solve or the questions you want to answer. This activity gives you an opportunity to apply these skills and prepare you for future EDA, where you will need to determine how best to structure your data.
# 
# In this activity, you are a member of an analytics team that provides insights to an investing firm. To help them decide which companies to invest in next, the firm wants insights into **unicorn companies**â€“companies that are valued at over one billion dollars.  
# 
# You will work with a dataset about unicorn companies, discovering characteristics of the data, structuring the data in ways that will help you draw meaningful insights, and using visualizations to analyze the data. Ultimately, you will draw conclusions about what significant trends or patterns you find in the dataset. This will develop your skills in EDA and your knowledge of functions that allow you to structure data.
# 
# 
# 
# 

# ## Step 1: Imports 

# ### Import relevant libraries and modules
# 
# Import the relevant Python libraries and modules that you will need to use. In this activity, you will use `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib.pyplot`.

# In[4]:


# Import the relevant Python libraries and modules needed in this lab.

### YOUR CODE HERE ###
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# ### Load the dataset into a DataFrame
# 
# The dataset provided is in the form of a csv file named `Unicorn_Companies.csv` and contains a subset of data on unicorn companies. As shown in this cell, the dataset has been automatically loaded in for you. You do not need to download the .csv file, or provide more code, in order to access the dataset and proceed with this lab. Please continue with this activity by completing the following instructions.

# In[5]:


# RUN THIS CELL TO IMPORT YOUR DATA.

### YOUR CODE HERE ###
companies = pd.read_csv("Unicorn_Companies.csv")


# ## Step 2: Data exploration
# 

# ### Display the first 10 rows of the data
# 
# In this section, you will discover what the dataset entails and answer questions to guide your exploration and analysis of the data. This is an important step in EDA. 
# 
# To begin, display the first 10 rows of the data to get an understanding of how the dataset is structured. 

# In[6]:

# ### Sort the data
# 
# In this section, you will continue your exploratory data analysis by structuring the data. This is an important step in EDA, as it allows you to glean valuable and interesting insights about the data afterwards.
# 
# To begin, sort the data so that you can get insights about when the companies were founded. Consider whether it would make sense to sort in ascending or descending order based on what you would like to find.

# 

# the oldest comapny was founded in year 1919 and after that another company which became unicorn came in 1979 after 1990 almost every year we can see a unicorn company in that year

# **Question:** Which library would you use to get the count of each distinct value in the `Year Founded` column? 
# 

# Pandas library

# **Question:** In the preceding box plot, what do you observe about the median value for `Years To Join` for each month?
# 

# In the preceding box plot, the median value for Years To Join is different for each month. Also, the median Years To Join is lower for the months of September and October. This could indicate that companies that reached unicorn status in early fall took less time to reach $1 billion valuation. This is because the number of companies is relatively close/consistent for each month. If that were not the case, it would be misleading to compare the median values from the box plots between months.

# ## Step 4: Results and evaluation
# 

# ### Visualize the time it took companies to reach unicorn status
# 
# In this section, you will evaluate the result of structuring the data, making observations, and gaining further insights about the data. 
# 
# Using the `companies` dataset, create a bar plot to visualize the average number of years it took companies to reach unicorn status with respect to when they were founded.

# **Question:** What trends do you notice in the data? Specifically, consider companies that were founded later on. How long did it take those companies to reach unicorn status?
# 

# With going forward in time the no. of years it takes to reach unicorn status is definately coming down

# ### Visualize the average valuation over the quarters
# 
# Using the subset of companies that joined in the years of interest, create a grouped bar plot to visualize the average valuation over the quarters, with two bars for each time interval. There will be two bars for each time interval. This allows you to compare quarterly values between the two years.

# Using slicing, extract the year component and the time interval that you specified, 
# and save them by adding two new columns into the subset.

# **Question:** What do you observe from the preceding grouped bar plot?
# 
#   

# year 2020 had most unicorn companies quarterly as compared to year 2021
# year 2021 quarter 1 had highest average valuation compared to the later period of that year

# **Question:** Is there any bias in the data that could potentially inform your analysis?
# 

# maybe location can be included which cities are seen 

# **Question:** What potential next steps could you take with your EDA?

# analyze data based on cities and same industry

# **Question:** Are there any unanswered questions you have about the data? If yes, what are they?
# 

# How many rounds of funding did each company require and when did this funding take place?
# Have any of these unicorn companies acquired other companies along the way? If so, which companies acquired other companies, which companies did they acquire, and when did the acquisitions take place?

# ## Considerations

# **What are some key takeaways that you learned from this lab?**

# i learned strucuting data is crucial also the datetime format is very necessary

# **What findings would you share with others?**

# we had 1074 companies data
# year 2015 had most succesfull unicorn 
# September and October month had taken on average less time to reach unicorn status
# 

# **What recommendations would you share with stakeholders based on these findings?**

# According to data analysis that was conducted on a dataset of 1074 unicorn companies, companies that joined in the months of September and October tended to take less time to become unicorns.
# Another finding was that many of the unicorn companies that were founded in 2021 were founded in the United States and belong to "Fintech", "E-commerce & direct-to-consumer", and "Internet software & services" industries. So if the stakeholders want to invest in companies founded in 2021, it would be a good idea to consider companies that belong to these industries, as they may be strong candidates for becoming unicorns.
# It was also discovered that the average valuation of companies that joined in 2021 is highest in the first quarter of the year, and the average valuation of companies that joined in 2020 is the third quarter of the year. When considering companies that newly join in the future, it would be worth closely looking at companies that join in the first and third quarters of the year.
# The data can be analyzed further to gather more insights that are specific to the interests of the investing firm and the stakeholders.
